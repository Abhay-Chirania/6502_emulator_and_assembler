# 6502_emulator_and_assembler
This repository contains 6502 assembler and 6502 emulator made from scratch in python.

6502 emulator: Supports all the operations that a 6502 microprocessor can perform except Interrupt request. This repo contains executable GUI where you can write assembly code and quickly emulate it and/or download bin file for the code. 

6502 assembler: Made completely from scratch. Supports all opcodes and addressing modes applicable in 6502 microprocessor. Note : The assembler currently does not support all the facilities of a generic assembler like storing string and sequence of data. Use "byte" or "word" keywords to store data in the memory.Look at Examples folder for more details. I am planning to add all the features of generic assembler in the future. 

Thanks to Dave Poo for his amazing "Emulating a CPU in C++" series on Youtube - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJgsuQoy9bc&amp;list=PLLwK93hM93Z13TRzPx9JqTIn33feefl37 

Feel free to report any bugs and issues in the assembler or emulator.
